# OOP Home Assignments

This repository contains my personal Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coursework exercises.

It is **not a full software project**.  
It is a collection of small practice tasks completed at home to improve my understanding of class topics.

## What is inside

- Java exercises from different topics and weeks
- Practice tasks on generics
- Practice tasks on design patterns
- Notes and small examples used during learning

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is educational:

- practice OOP concepts
- complete optional and regular homework tasks
- keep progress in one place

## How to use

You can open this repository in IntelliJ IDEA and run exercises from the `src` folder by topic and task number.
